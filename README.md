# Smoluchowski-Rotor-Chain
Smoluchowski-Rotor-Chain is a simple C++ program devoted to the diffusive simulation of a chain of hydrodynamically independent 2D rotors interacting with a nearest-neighbour potential. The software solves the Symmetrized Fokker-Planck-Smoluchowski eigenvalue problem by expansion over a basis set.
